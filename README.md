# CPE133-SystemVerilog-Projects
This is where I will showcase and store projects done in SystemVerilog HDL in the Vivado IDE

This is also where I will give a brief description of each file:
1. 2_1_MUX is a 2-1 Multiplexor
2. FA is a Full Adder
3. HA is a Half Adder
4. lab2-learningVerilog was an exercise in structural modelling
5. lab3 was another exercise in structural modelling
6. MUX_4_1 is a 4-1 MUX using instantiations of the 2-1 MUX 
7. practicalMidterm is the code from the practical portion of the first Midterm exam
8. RCA_nbit is an n bit Ripple Carry Adder with n being determined by a parameter in the instantiation
